# LAB11
THIS IS THE README FILE FOR THE LAB 11.
IN THIS LAB WE NEEDED TO CREATE A PROGRAM WHICH IS HAVING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE 'PIPE' MECHANISM

THE PROGRAM IS CREATED USING THE POPEN AND PCLOSE

THE FLOW OF THE PROGRAM IS LIKE THIS -
IT TAKES THE  COMMANDS FROM THE USER,
THEN IT REMOVES THE GAP BETWEEN DIFFERENT COMMANDS ENTERED AND THEN 
THEY ARE CHECKED IF THE THE COMMAND IS 'QUIT' OR NOT...IF IT IS  'QUIT'
THEN THE PROGRAM IS TERMINATED OTHERWISE THE FUNCTION 'MYFUNC' IS CALLLED AND IT EXECUTES 
THE COMMANDS ENTERED USING THE POPEN AND PCLOSE
